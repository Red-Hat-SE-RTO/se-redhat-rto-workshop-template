= Module 2: Core Concepts

[%hardbreaks]
== Module Overview

This module introduces the fundamental concepts and core technical foundations of {product_name}. By the end of this module, participants will understand the key architectural principles, basic operational paradigms, and essential components that define the solution.

== Key Learning Objectives

* Understand the foundational architecture
* Explore core technical components
* Identify key design principles
* Recognize standard operational patterns
* Understand integration mechanisms

== Architectural Overview

=== Reference Architecture

{product_name} is built on a {primary_architecture_type} model that emphasizes:

* *Scalability*: Ability to expand and contract resources dynamically
* *Flexibility*: Support for diverse workload types
* *Reliability*: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance
* *Performance*: Optimized resource utilization

=== Core Components

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Component | Description 

| Control Plane 
| Manages overall system state, scheduling, and orchestration

| Data Plane
| Handles actual workload execution and resource allocation

| Management Layer
| Provides interfaces for configuration, monitoring, and administration

| Networking Component
| Enables communication between different system elements
|===

== Technical Design Principles

=== Principle 1: Declarative Configuration

{product_name} follows a declarative model where:

* Desired state is explicitly defined
* System automatically reconciles current state with desired state
* Configuration is version-controlled and reproducible

=== Principle 2: Immutable Infrastructure

Key characteristics include:

* Infrastructure defined as code
* Consistent, reproducible deployments
* Easy rollback and version management
* Reduced configuration drift

=== Principle 3: Abstraction and Portability

The solution provides:

* Consistent interface across different environments
* Abstraction from underlying infrastructure
* Support for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments

== Integration Patterns

=== Standard Integration Mechanisms

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Integration Type | Description | Use Cases

| API-Based 
| Programmatic interaction through defined interfaces
| Automation, third-party tool integration

| Event-Driven
| Reactive interactions based on state changes
| Monitoring, automated workflows

| Declarative Webhooks
| Configurable event notification and response systems
| Continuous integration, automated governance
|===

== Operational Workflows

=== Standard Operational Patterns

. *Initialization*: System bootstrap and configuration
. *Deployment*: Resource provisioning and placement
. *Management*: Ongoing monitoring and maintenance
. *Scaling*: Dynamic resource adjustment
. *Decommissioning*: Controlled resource removal

== Security Considerations

=== Core Security Principles

* Identity and Access Management
* Network Segmentation
* Encryption at Rest and in Transit
* Audit and Compliance Logging

== Hands-on Exercise: Core Concept Exploration

=== Exercise Objectives

* Demonstrate core architectural principles
* Practice basic configuration
* Explore integration mechanisms
