== Key Learning Objectives

* Understand infrastructure deployment models
* Learn about scalability and resource management
* Explore infrastructure-as-code principles
* Develop skills in infrastructure provisioning
* Understand monitoring and observability strategies

== Infrastructure Deployment Models

=== Deployment Topologies

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Deployment Type | Characteristics | Key Considerations

| Single-Node
| Minimal resource footprint
| Development, small-scale testing

| Clustered
| Multiple nodes, distributed processing
| Production, high availability

| Hybrid
| Mix of on-premises and cloud resources
| Flexible scaling, cost optimization

| Edge-Optimized
| Lightweight, resource-constrained environments
| IoT, remote locations
|===

== Resource Management

=== Resource Allocation Strategies

==== Compute Resources
* CPU allocation models
* Memory management
* Performance optimization techniques

==== Storage Provisioning
* Storage class definitions
* Dynamic vs. static provisioning
* Performance and capacity planning

==== Network Configuration
* Network overlay models
* Multi-network support
* Network policy implementation

== Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

=== Core IaC Principles

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Principle | Description

| Declarative Configuration
| Define desired infrastructure state explicitly

| Version Control
| Treat infrastructure configurations like software code

| Immutability
| Create new infrastructure instead of modifying existing

| Automated Validation
| Implement continuous validation and testing
|===

=== IaC Tools and Frameworks

* Terraform
* Ansible
* CloudFormation
* Custom orchestration tools

== Scaling Strategies

=== Horizontal Scaling
* Dynamic node addition
* Automatic resource allocation
* Load distribution mechanisms

=== Vertical Scaling
* Resource allocation adjustments
* Performance tuning
* Capacity planning

== Monitoring and Observability

=== Monitoring Components

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Monitoring Aspect | Key Metrics

| Performance
| CPU utilization, memory consumption, network throughput

| Health
| Service availability, error rates, response times

| Resource Utilization
| Capacity planning, workload distribution

| Compliance
| Security configurations, policy adherence
|===

=== Observability Tools

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* ELK Stack
* Native monitoring solutions

== Hands-on Exercise: Infrastructure Provisioning

=== Exercise Objectives
